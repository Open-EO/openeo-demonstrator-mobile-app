# openEO Demonstrator Mobile App

This is the Android and iOS mobile app demonstrating the possible application of openEO in a mobile environment. It offers requesting
various EO indices from the backend servers listed on the [openEO Hub](https://hub.openeo.org/) (some might require a 
valid subscription to be used) and also allows accessing custom servers supporting the openEO API in the same way.

The mobile app is built using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
and uses the [openEO JavaScript client](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-js-client)
to access the openEO servers. Data is visualised on a map using [CesiumJS](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium)
while data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) powers a custom geocoding backend 
to search for locations.

## Features

- Searching for geographic features/locations (countries, cities, villages, regions, etc) on a custom-built geocoding backend
- Requesting and visualising EO data for the selected location. Depending on the support from the backend, the following
views may be available:
    - NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index)
    - NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index)
    - NDBI (Normalised Difference Built-up Index)
    - NDSI (Normalised Difference Snow Index)
    - False colour image "Agriculture"
    - True colour image
- Storing favourite locations
- Accessing openEO backend servers listed on the openEO Hub (some will require a valid user account, possibly a paid subscription)
and adding custom servers for:
    - Listing data collections
    - Listing processes
    - Listing current jobs (results cannot be viewed within the mobile app)

## Development

The project can be installed locally for development and to run the latest version directly on your Android or iOS
phone in development mode.

### Installation

After cloning the repository, run the following commands to load all the required third-party NPM modules and to prepare
the project for building:

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm run cordova prepare
```

This should generate the Android and iOS projects. To generate the resources for Android and iOS without having an Ionic
account, you can use the following command instead of `ionic cordova resources`:

```bash
$ npm run ionic cordova resources --cordova-res
```

This is also documented in the ionic-cli issue [#3762](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/issues/3762).

### Running in development mode

To run the mobile app on your Android device with live reload enabled, run:

```bash
$ npm run ionic cordova run android -- --device -lc --ssl --no-native-run --external
```

## Continuous integration

Add an environment variable `IOS_BUILD_TEAM` and set it to the Apple Development Team ID used to sign the iOS build.
